        <br>
        <h3>The Chauhan ruler Prithviraj Chauhan was a great ruler of present day Delhi. He was a great warrior and he could shoot the arrow with only sound. Mahammad Ghori who wanted to steel all the wealth of Delhi and wanted his country (Ghazni) to be called the golden sparrow instead of India. He once fought with Prithviraj Chauhan and lost and then he was dragged to Prithvi raj Chauhan but, Prithviraj Chauhan left him free thinking he would not repeat the same next time but, Ghori again fought. Like this Ghori fought with Prithviraj Chauhan seven times and lost all the time with Prithviraj Chauhan. Jaychand who was conducting the marriage of his daughter (swayamvar) and sent the invitations to many kings but not Prithviraj Chauhan. His daughter wanted to marry Prithviraj Chauhan but, as he was  an enemy of Jaychand he did not let his daughter marry him. Then his daughter sent a secret invitation to Prithviraj Chauhan and invited him to her swayamvar. Then to show that Prithviraj Chauhan was a soldier of Jaychand he made a statue of him and made it stand at the doors. When the swayamvar started Jaychand's daughter went and kept the mala on the statue of Prithviraj Chauhan. Then Prithviraj Chauhan came there and took Jaychand's daughter and went. Jaychand wanted to take revenge of this from Prithviraj Chauhan but, he could not fight alone to get victory. Then Ghori and Jaychand together fought with Prithviraj Chauhan and won a victory on him then Ghori captured Prithviraj Chauhan. Then Prithviraj Chauhan was continuously watching Ghori's eyes by which Ghori got angry and made him blind and then he put Prithviraj Chauhan in the jail(karagar). Then Prithviraj Chauhan's close friend Chandbardai told Ghori that Prithviraj Chauhan was a great warrior than him. Then Ghori told Chandbardai that if Prithviraj Chauhan did not proove his greatness then he would chop his (Chandbardai's) head. Then Prithviraj Chauhan was bought to the ground and Ghori told him to shoot the arrow to the aim then Chandbardai told something to Prithviraj Chauhan in their code language which no one could understand exept for them. The lines were (Char bans, chaubis gaj, angul ashta praman, Ta upar sultan hai, Chuke mat Chauhan.) Translated to englishðŸ‘‰(Four measures ahead of you and 24 yards away, as measured with eight finger measurment, is  seated then sultan. Do not miss him, Chauhan) Then Prithviraj Chauhan shot Ghori and Prithviraj Chauhan and Chandbardai stabbed each other so, that they could not fall in the hands of Ghori's soldiers. </h3>
